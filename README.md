# SimpleToken

SimpleToken is a simple token contract written in the Solidity[^5^][5] programming language used to develop smart contracts on Ethereum[^1^][1]. This contract keeps track of account balances, total supply, and transfer transactions. It includes the necessary functions to create a token contract compliant with the ERC20[^6^][6] standard.

## Features

- Generates an initially set amount of tokens and assigns them to the contract creator.
- Allows token holders to transfer tokens to other addresses.
- Reports an event for each transfer operation.
- Allows querying each address's token balance and total token supply.
